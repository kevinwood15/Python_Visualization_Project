# Python_Visualization_Project


This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
This project uses data of bikeshare user data from the San Francisco Bay Area.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I use Python visualization libraries of matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.express to systematically explore the dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. I also plot maps with a heat map feature to show frequency between different bikeshare stations using plotly.express.  

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in the selected dataset, which explores "who is the median bikeshare user". This is important for a company to know, because it lets them better cater products and services to their core market. The primary method of conveying my findings is through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
