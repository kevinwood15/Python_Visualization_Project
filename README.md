# Python_Visualization_Project


This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
This project uses data of bikeshare user data from the San Francisco Bay Area.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables using matplotlib and seaborn. I also plot maps with a heat map feature to show frequency between different bikeshare stations using plotly.express.  


In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings is through transforming the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
